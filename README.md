# SIMPATHIC_SCOLIA_2025
Repository for mining disease-specific information with in-silico models aiming at drug re-purposing. Includes data, code and results. Developed for SCOLIA 2025.

## Link Prediction Tasks
- **Drug-Diseease**
- **Drug-Gene**
- **Drug-Phenotype**

## Table of Contents
- ./Data: the drug indication datasets per task.
- ./Harvesting:
- ./Extracted_Features: the extracted features based on our disease-specific Knowledge Graph.
- ./Link_Prediction: the Python scripts we used to evaluate our approach and to generate the prioritized drug candidates lists per task.
- ./Results: includes the calculated evaluation metrics and the proposed drug candidates lists per task.

## Scholarly Data Retrieval
In this work we are focusing on 9 rare neurological, neurometabolic and neuromuscular syndromes, namely:

- Spinocerebellar Ataxia type 3 (SCA3)
- Leigh syndrome (Leigh)
- Congenital Neurotransmitter defects (CNT)
- Pyridoxine Dependent Epilepsy (PDE )
- Glutaric Aciduria (GA1)
- PMM2-Congenital Disorder Glycosylation (PMM2)
- Zellweger Spectrum Disorders (ZSD)
- Myotonic Dystrophy type 1 (DM1)
- Congenital Myasthenic Syndrome (CMS)
